# SimpleDriving
**A mobile game application developed with Unity that allows users to drive around a track**

## Introduction
This game was developed solely by myslef, Thomas Cogley.  I utilized the Unity engine to develop the game.  It was created with free assets from the Unity marketplace.  I used multiple C# scripts to develop the game.

## Purpose of the Game
The purpose of this game is to go around a track without hitting any objects.  The track is always the same.  This game is designed to not be very difficult and to be more relaxing.

## How to Play
The user starts the game by hitting the play button from the main menu.  As the vehicle constantly moves forward the user must tap on the left or right of the screen to move the truck left or right.  As the user continues without hitting an object the time at the top of the screen counts up.  The longer the user is playing the speed of the truck is increasing.  This makes the game more difficult the longer it is played.  When the user hits an object the game is over.  If the user earned a higher score than previous attempts, the high score is saved on the main menu.
